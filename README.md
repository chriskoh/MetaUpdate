# MetaUpdate
Hearthstone Daily Meta Update

The "meta" in Hearthstone has been known to change drastically in as little as a weeks time.  All players know the feeling of taking a break from the game for even as little as 24 hours, only to come back to half the players playing a new deck that was not around yesterday.

Using the data gathered by Vicious Syndicate hourly, I am creating a tool that will report the 10 most commmon decks for the last 24 hours and inform players daily what the "meta" is currenly.  This way players wont be surprised when half the players start playing something new, we will be ready!
